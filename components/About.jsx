          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>// I am not your normal developer</p>
          <p>
            I have spent the last 12 years in the fire service, working as a
            professional firefighter and paramedic. I have always had a knack
            for technology and working with computers. In 2019, I started
            working with HTML and CSS to make some minor edits on a small
            business website that I was operating. What I thought were just a
            few small edits turned into a love for programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascinated by how intricate programming can be, I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started learning JavaScript and became even more
            enthused about making websites interactive. I then began freelancing
            for e-commerce companies on the Shopify platform. Currently, I am
            dedicating my time to building projects with React JS, Firebase, and
            learning new technologies.
